> <b>Graduated in Information Systems from Nove de Julho University and in Project Management from USP, I entered the world of technology in 2011, working from supporting Asset Management Systems to Web Development and Systems Analysis. With a solid background in business and client analysis, I currently work as a Software Developer at one of the largest technology companies in Brazil. Understanding the need for Front-End and Back-End development, I decided to publish my projects on my GitHub.</b>\
